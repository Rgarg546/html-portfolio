<h1>About Me</h1>


<p>My Name is Rohan Garg. I am from haryana , India. I am learning full stack development by my own. Currently I am in Initial stage of front end development.
  But My progress is going good . I am able to make multiple page project in Html. I know there is alot to learn , but i am sure that my dedication and my intrest towards this course will never let me stop learning  </p>

<p>Apart from that I have done masters in computer science , then after that i engaged my self in govt. job preparation, but i didn't get success.So I decided to move on , and to do what i really likes to do . 
  when I start coding i feel like swimming in imagination world of my own , i think thats the main part to be a creative designer.
